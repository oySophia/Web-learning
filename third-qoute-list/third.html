		<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
		<ul>
		<li>Walla Walla, </li>
		<li>WA, </li>
		<li>Magic City, </li>
		<li>ID, </li>
		<li>Bountiful, </li>
		<li>UT, </li>
		<li>Last Chance, </li>
		<li>CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
		</ul></p>

		<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
		<blockqoute>Passing cars, <br>when you can't see,<br> May get you, A glimpse, <br>of eternity.</blockqoute>
		<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
		<h2>June 2, 2005</h2>
		<img src="pic/3.png">
		<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because i'm not on a Segway, I wasn't able to 
		bring a whole lot with me: Cellphone, digital camera, and a protein bar. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins 
		with one Segway.</q></p>
